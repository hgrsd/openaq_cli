## OpenAQ_CLI
OpenAQ_CLI is a command-line API wrapper for OpenAQ (http://www.openaq.org): the world's first open, real-time and historical air quality platform, aggregating government-measured and research-grade data - entirely open-source.

OpenAQ_CLI is written in C, using libcurl for HTTP requests (https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) and jansson (http://www.digip.org/jansson/) for JSON functionality.
